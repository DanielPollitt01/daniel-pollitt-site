Oh boy, I've gone and done it now. After years of switching out tech over and over again I've finally found the sweet spot for everyday carry and mobile work station. I don't know if I have a bad case of the ADHD (I keep getting recommended YouTube videos about it but for some reason I can't get past the introduction of these before moving on to the next video) but I am one of those people that has never been happy with their setup and has constantly chased the next thing that would make everything click. See my distro hopping mania at <a href="#" data-post="6-months-windows-free">I am now 6 months windows free and only barely feeling the itch</a>. But with the last piece of the puzzle finally clicking in to place I am now ready to hang my hat on my final mobile workstation.

All of this has finally come together with the help of a friend and colleague that has been chasing the same dream as me. We have both been attempting to make our mobile phones the core of our setups for months and while the ergonomics and obviously the portability were great from nearly the beginning the issue really came down to a lack of power to get everything we wanted done. Ultimately there really isn't a usable way to code with your mobile phone.

I had tried VS code running on a local server and jumping into the browser to get work done, but where are my files and plugins? Even when I got these working there was no persistance across sessions. What I really wanted was nvim anyway, technically possible to run in termux but then try and setup a python env, truly awful experience. Then with my recent switch to Cursor the gaps really only started to widen...

I wanted my desktop PC running Omarchy to be portable. I can't believe I hadn't thought of it earlier when my mate mentioned SSH. This really opened up all possibilities, just SSH into my PC where my files and my environment was already running, the hardware was always running anyway for serving Plex.

After less than 15 mins of setting up Tailscale on both my PC and phone and I was flying with Opencode on my phone, the Cursor alternative I didn't know I needed in my life.

Here I am today writing this up in neovim in a cafe on my phone all the way in Adelaide, 1400kms away from the hardware that is powering it all.

Endgame feels good man.

**PS.** I think I need these to be truly end game, <a href="https://www.viture.com/blog/nothing-beats-this-combo-viture-pro-xr-glasses-viture-pro-neckband?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22738650182&gbraid=0AAAAAp0494G_LePL2gN8hfGYqmCrnWuwK&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyvHLBhDlARIsAHxl6xpHx0Y-fN7FNTkA7ZNsCt4_bdpAYVi1C9-WlFixxOsbnekMpzWzTAYaAnJtEALw_wcB">Viture Pro XR</a>

**PPS.** Also, what about the ability to write and draw, maybe I need the Galaxy Z Fold6 as well?
