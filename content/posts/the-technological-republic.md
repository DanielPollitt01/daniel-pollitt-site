I have long been an admirer of the work of Palantir, the often maligned (not without some merit) tech company. As a system-a-phile we don't have a better example of putting the power of data into the hands of people for action. If business intelligence is about showing you whats going on at any time, data science is about telling you what the data implies, but the domain of turning these insights kinetic is for the rest of us and in my experience this is where we lose a lot of the momentum.

When I went searching for my own answer to this question to tackle a logistics issue that had gone nuclear I stumbled across this article [US Special Forces transformation](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/98/2/587/6526922?login=false). I speak more about the particulars of how I handled the issue [here](http://danielpollitt.xyz/projects.html?project=delivery-optimisation), but the Special Forces example highlighted 2 key areas that we were lacking in:
1. There was no centralised connected source of information that joined disparate pieces of data to form a picture of the customer experience
2. Just like our data WE were disconnected and working heavily in silos

To resolve these issues took extreme measures from senior leadership that likely would not have been done without the crisis that we found ourselves in, however, the results of tackling these 2 issues was astronomical, leading to transcendental levels of interdepartment and personal flow. Palantir have productised this and are selling this solution to everyone. For giving everyone this ability I commend them.

I picked up [The Technological Republic](https://techrepublicbook.com/) to chase the next great idea from the mind of Alex Karp and the incredible team at Palantir, maybe get a hint towards the new thing that would unlock in me an area of trapped potential, but somewhat disappointingly, I instead mostly got a political plea. The central thesis of Karp is that the west (mostly Europe in this instance) had become largely complacent, chasing profits over protection with the use of our technological advantage and that a reckoning was on the horizon as China and Russia press to close the gap.

Karp tells us that we have lost societies brightest to building trinkets and maximising share prices for nothing, technology has largely not improved our lives in the last 50 years as is evidenced in the Solow paradox "you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." 

Hence the need for a Technological Republic, tech bros fully unleashed. But not for profits, the best of us should be working on armament, not just to beat our competitors/enemies but complete dominance. I can't really fault the idea, that's the problem with run away cold wars, it won't stop until one puts down the arms, but then what if the other doesn't stop when we do? We lose the race and potentially our way of life, the risk is too high and therefore the logical step is to win and win big.

Its all so tiring.

I can't help but think that this same love for dominating could be better served by aiming it at the problems of human suffering and maximising every persons potential. Imagine the best and brightest of our societies (maybe even those of us with more mediocre capabilities) working towards dominating cancer, or ageing, or hunger, or poverty. Surely we can find common ground with those lovers of technology and human flourishing in Russia and China to break down barriers and create together, luckily we already are.
