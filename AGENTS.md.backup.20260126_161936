## Code Style Guidelines

### HTML Structure & Conventions
- **DOCTYPE & Meta**: Always include `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `lang="en"`, and viewport meta tag
- **Semantic HTML5**: Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` appropriately
- **Document Structure**: Navigation symbol + menu at end of body, main content in `.unified-container`
- **Titles**: Unique page titles following pattern "Daniel - PageName"
- **Script Placement**: All inline scripts before `</body>` tag
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, roles, and semantic markup required
- **Links**: Use relative paths without leading slash (e.g., `href="about.html"`)
- **Cache Busting**: Link CSS with version parameter (e.g., `styles.css?v=1.6`)

### CSS Architecture & Design System
- **CSS Variables**: Define design tokens in `:root` using `--variable-name` pattern
- **Color Palette**: Primary green (`#4A7C59`), light green (`#7db59f`), dark green (`#3c8b5b`)
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono font family, rem units for all spacing/typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px and 480px
- **Layout System**: 
  - `.unified-container` as main wrapper
  - `.traditional-content` for standard page layouts
  - `.left-content`/`.right-blurb` for projects page
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- **Component Patterns**: 
  - Navigation symbol (hamburger menu) fixed top-right
  - Interactive list items with hover states
  - Blog post layouts with margin notes
- **Utility Classes**: Spacing utilities (`.mt-2`, `.mb-2`, etc.), text utilities
- **Transitions**: Subtle `0.2s ease` transitions for hover states

### JavaScript Patterns & Conventions
- **Variable Declaration**: Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment needed
- **Event Handling**: 
  - Always use `e.stopPropagation()` for dropdown/click-outside functionality
  - Support keyboard navigation (Enter, Space for activation, Escape to close)
  - Use `addEventListener` over inline event handlers
- **DOM Manipulation**: 
  - Cache DOM element references in variables
  - Use `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` for element selection
  - Manipulate classes using `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()`, `classList.toggle()`
- **Interactive Components**:
  - Navigation menu toggle with click-outside detection
  - Interactive hover states for list items
  - URL parameter handling for shareable states
  - Dynamic content loading with `innerHTML` templates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing elements/data
- **Performance**: Event delegation for multiple similar elements
- **Code Organization**: Small, page-specific scripts with clear functional separation

### Naming Conventions
- **CSS Classes**: kebab-case (`.nav-symbol`, `.blog-post-content`)
- **JavaScript Variables**: camelCase (const `navSymbol`, let `postImage`)
- **HTML Attributes**: kebab-case (`data-post`, `data-image`)
- **File Names**: Lowercase with hyphens (index.html, about.html, styles.css)

### Content & Data Patterns
- **Blog Posts**: Object structure with `title`, `content`, `date`, `marginNotes` arrays
- **Project Data**: Similar structure with `title`, `description`, `technologies`, etc.
- **Interactive Elements**: Use `data-*` attributes to associate elements with data
- **URL Management**: Use `URLSearchParams` for state management and shareable links

### Performance & Optimization
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading with opacity transitions
- **CSS**: Minimize redundant selectors, use efficient class-based targeting
- **JavaScript**: Avoid global variables, use proper scoping
- **Cache Management**: Update CSS version number when making changes

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels, roles, and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus states, logical tab order
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance for all text/background combinations
- **Alternative Text**: Meaningful alt text for all images

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Manual Testing**: Navigation, responsive design, accessibility
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Device Testing**: Mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader testing, keyboard-only navigation
- **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal links work correctly

## PAI Workflows

### 1. Consistent AI Image Integration
**Objective**: Generate themed snapshots (e.g., Hiromix style) and integrate them into interactive hover lists.

**Tools & Environment**:
- **Pack Location**: `/home/dan/projects/active/ai-image-generation`
- **Setup**: Requires a virtual environment (`venv`) with dependencies from `requirements.txt` and an `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  python3 src/cli/main.py generate --style [style_name] --scene "[prompt]" --output "/home/dan/projects/active/resume_website" --name "[role_id]"
  ```

**Procedure**:
1. **Generate**: Run the CLI tool from the pack directory to generate PNGs.
2. **Normalize**: The tool appends timestamps (e.g., `role_timestamp_001.png`). Rename these to clean, predictable names (e.g., `role.png`) in the website root.
3. **Trigger**: Add `data-image="role.png"` to the `<a>` tag in the interactive list.
4. **Logic**: Ensure the page's `<script>` handles `mouseenter` by updating the target `img.src` from the `data-image` attribute and setting `opacity: 1`.
5. **Reset**: Handle `mouseleave` by setting `opacity: 0`.

### 2. Automated Blog Creation
**Objective**: Streamline the process of adding new blog posts with integrated AI image generation.

**Tools & Environment**:
- **Source Folder**: `/home/dan/projects/active/resume_website/content/posts` (Markdown files with YAML frontmatter)
- **Script**: `/home/dan/projects/active/resume_website/scripts/create_blog.py`
- **Dependency**: Uses the `venv` from `/home/dan/projects/packs/ai_image_generation`.

**Frontmatter Requirements**:
```yaml
title: "Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
style: "hiromix" # or any other style guide name
master_image_prompt: "Description for the hover preview image"
margin_notes:
  - "Note 1"
  - "Note 2"
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Draft**: Create a `.md` file in `content/posts/`.
2. **In-Body Generation**: Use `[[generate: "prompt"]]` within the Markdown body to trigger additional image generations and auto-injection.
3. **Execute**: 
    ```bash
     source /home/dan/projects/packs/ai_image_generation/venv/bin/activate
     python3 scripts/create_blog.py content/posts/your-post.md

   ```
4. **Verification**: Check `blog.html` for the new entry in `blogPosts` and the interactive list.

### 3. Responsive Article Images
**Objective**: Ensure images embedded within articles (blog posts, projects) are visually balanced and don't overwhelm the viewport on high-resolution displays.

**Implementation**:
- **CSS Rule**: A global rule in `styles.css` targets `img` tags within `.blog-post-text`, `.traditional-content`, and `.post-embedded-image`.
- **Constraints**: 
  - `max-height: 50vh`: Limits image height to 50% of the viewport.
  - `max-width: 100%`: Ensures horizontal fit.
  - `width: auto; height: auto`: Preserves aspect ratio.
- **Styling**: Center alignment (`margin: 2rem auto`), subtle border-radius, and shadow for professional presentation.

**Automation**: The `create_blog.py` script generates clean HTML without inline styles, allowing the global CSS to handle all sizing and presentation.

## Lessons Learned: Blog Creation & Debugging Session

### Session Overview (2026-01-25)
Successfully added a new blog post "The technological republic and why we can't have nice things" from markdown source, with automated AI image generation. Encountered and resolved several deployment and JavaScript issues.

### What Worked Well

#### 1. Automated Blog Creation Workflow
- **Script Automation**: The `create_blog.py` script successfully:
  - Parsed markdown with YAML frontmatter
  - Generated master hover image and embedded content image using AI
  - Converted markdown to HTML
  - Injected new post into `blog.html` (both data object and interactive list)
- **Image Generation**: AI image pack integration worked flawlessly with proper prompts
- **Content Migration**: Successfully extracted content from external markdown file in user's Documents folder

#### 2. Systematic Debugging Approach
- **Git History Analysis**: Checked commit logs to verify what was deployed
- **File Verification**: Confirmed all files (blog.html, images) were committed and pushed
- **GitHub Actions**: Used `gh run list` to monitor deployment status
- **Deployment Success**: GitHub Pages deployment completed successfully

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Blog Not Visible After Push
**Problem**: User reported blog post not showing after pushing to master
**Root Cause**: Browser cache and CSS version not updated
**Solution**:
- Bumped CSS version from `v=1.6` to `v=1.7` in blog.html
- Instructed user to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- **Lesson**: Always increment CSS version parameter when making changes to ensure cache busting

#### Issue 2: Extra Closing Brace in CSS
**Problem**: Syntax error in `styles.css` - extra `}` at end of file (line 1012)
**Detection**: Manual code review while investigating deployment issues
**Solution**: Removed the extra closing brace
**Lesson**: Always validate CSS syntax, especially after manual edits

#### Issue 3: JavaScript Reference Error (Critical)
**Problem**: Blog posts wouldn't display when clicked, hover images not working
**Root Cause**: Added `console.log('Blog script initialized. Posts loaded:', Object.keys(blogPosts));` BEFORE `blogPosts` was defined
**Impact**: JavaScript error broke entire page interactivity:
  - Blog post click handlers failed
  - Hover image functionality broken
  - All interactive features non-functional
**Solution**: Moved console.log statement to AFTER the `blogPosts` object definition
**Lesson**: **CRITICAL** - Never reference variables before they are defined. Always place debug logging AFTER variable declarations.

#### Issue 4: Placeholder Link Cleanup
**Problem**: Old placeholder link for the post existed in the HTML
**Solution**: Removed the duplicate/placeholder entry to keep the list clean
**Lesson**: Check for existing placeholder content when adding new dynamic entries

### Best Practices Established

#### JavaScript Variable Scope
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Reference before declaration
console.log(myVar);
const myVar = "value";

// ✅ CORRECT - Reference after declaration
const myVar = "value";
console.log(myVar);
```

#### Cache Busting Strategy
- Always increment CSS version when making changes: `styles.css?v=1.X`
- Document current version in code comments
- Instruct users to hard refresh after deployment

#### Deployment Verification Checklist
1. Verify all files committed: `git status`
2. Check commit contents: `git show --name-only [commit-hash]`
3. Verify push succeeded: `git log -n 1`
4. Monitor deployment: `gh run list --limit 1`
5. Wait for deployment completion (~60 seconds)
6. Hard refresh browser to clear cache

#### Automated Script Validation
- The `create_blog.py` script works reliably when:
  - Virtual environment is activated
  - Frontmatter includes all required fields
  - Image generation prompts are descriptive
  - Source markdown is in correct location

### Tools & Commands Used

#### Git & Deployment
```bash
git status                              # Check working tree
git log -n 5                           # Recent commits
git show --name-only [hash]            # Files in commit
gh run list --limit 5                  # GitHub Actions status
git add . && git commit -m "msg"       # Stage and commit
git push                               # Deploy to remote
```

#### File Analysis
```bash
ls -l [file]                           # Check file existence
sed -n 'NUMBERp' [file]               # Read specific line
tail -n 20 [file]                     # Check end of file
wc -c                                 # Count characters
grep -F 'pattern' [file]              # Fixed string search
```

#### Blog Creation
    ```bash
source /home/dan/projects/packs/ai_image_generation/venv/bin/activate
python3 scripts/create_blog.py content/posts/the-technological-republic.md
```

### Critical Warnings

1. **JavaScript Execution Order**: Always define variables before referencing them. A single reference error will break the entire script execution.

2. **CSS Cache**: Browser caching is aggressive. Always use versioned CSS links and increment on changes.

3. **Console Logging**: While useful for debugging, improperly placed console.log statements can cause runtime errors. Place them strategically after all dependencies are loaded.

4. **Deployment Timing**: GitHub Pages deployments take 30-60 seconds. Always wait for completion before testing.

5. **Hard Refresh Required**: After deployment, users MUST hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R) to see changes.

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Blog post created and integrated successfully
- ✅ AI images generated and linked correctly
- ✅ Interactive hover functionality working
- ✅ Click-to-read functionality restored
- ✅ All content displaying properly
- ✅ Deployment successful and live

### Future Improvements
1. Add JavaScript validation/linting to pre-commit hooks
2. Create a CSS validation step in deployment pipeline
3. Add automated browser cache testing
4. Document CSS version numbers in a changelog
5. Consider moving blog posts data to external JSON file to avoid manual HTML editing

### Session Overview (2026-01-25)
Successfully implemented site-wide responsive image constraints for article content, resolving issues with excessively large images on high-resolution displays.

### What Worked Well

#### 1. Site-Wide CSS Normalization
- **Global Rule**: Moving from inline styles in `create_blog.py` to a global CSS rule in `styles.css` ensured consistency across all articles (blog, projects, philosophy).
- **Viewport-Relative Sizing**: Using `max-height: 50vh` proved effective for maintaining readability by ensuring images never dominate more than half the vertical space, regardless of screen resolution.

#### 2. Clean Automation
- **Script Refinement**: Updated `create_blog.py` to output clean HTML (`<img>` tags without inline `width`/`height`), delegating all styling to the CSS architecture.
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Successfully identified and updated existing blog posts in `blog.html` to remove hardcoded styles, bringing the entire history into compliance with the new standard.

#### 3. Proactive Cache Busting
- **Unified Versioning**: Bumping the CSS version across all HTML files ensured that the new layout constraints were applied immediately for the user without requiring manual cache clearing.

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

#### Issue: Oversized Article Images
**Problem**: Images in blog posts were set to `width: 100%`, making them massive on 1920x1080 screens and requiring excessive scrolling.
**Solution**: Implemented `max-height: 50vh`, `width: auto`, and `max-width: 100%` in `styles.css`.

### Best Practices Established

1. **Delegate Styling to CSS**: Avoid inline styles in automation scripts. Use semantic classes and target them in the main stylesheet.
2. **Relative Height Constraints**: For content-heavy pages, use `vh` units for large assets to ensure they scale relative to the browser window.
3. **Unified Versioning**: When updating global CSS, update the version parameter in ALL HTML files, even if the content hasn't changed.

## Lessons Learned: Image Integration & Refinement

### Session Overview (2026-01-25)
Resolved issues with image scaling and borders in hover previews, and iterated on AI image generation to achieve high-quality abstract visuals for professional roles.

### What Worked Well

#### 1. CSS Scaling Fixes
- **Responsive Aspect Ratio**: Using `height: auto`, `max-height`, and `object-fit: contain` solved the cropping issue. This ensures images of any aspect ratio are fully visible without distortion or clipping.
- **Clean Aesthetic**: Removing `border` and `background-color` from the hover display classes allowed images (especially those with transparency) to blend seamlessly with the site's minimalist design.

#### 2. Iterative AI Image Generation
- **Specificity in Prompts**: Explicitly requesting "no text" and specific details (e.g., "tan/brown military boots" for ADF) corrected common AI generation errors.
- **Pivot to Abstraction**: When realistic representations (people/offices) felt "off" or cluttered, switching to "stylized patterns" produced more professional and on-theme results.
- **Drafting Prompts**: Sharing the full prompt with the user before generation allowed for collaborative refinement and reduced wasted iterations.

#### 3. Versioned Cache Busting
- Consistently incrementing the CSS version (e.g., `v=1.9` -> `v=2.2`) across all HTML files successfully forced browser refreshes for both CSS and the newly generated assets.

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Image Cropping
**Problem**: Images were holding horizontal scale but being cut off at the top/bottom.
**Root Cause**: Fixed `height: 200px` combined with `object-fit: cover`.
**Solution**: Changed to `height: auto`, `max-height: 300px`, and `object-fit: contain`.

#### Issue 2: Tooling Path Discrepancy
**Problem**: Documentation pointed to `/home/dan/projects/packs/ai_image_generation`, but the active tool was at `/home/dan/projects/active/ai-image-generation`.
**Solution**: Used `find` and `ls` to locate the active project directory and correct the path in the CLI commands.

#### Issue 3: Style Guide Naming
**Problem**: Requesting style `--style hiromix` failed because the required key in the system was `hiromix_style_90s`.
**Solution**: Inspected `ai_image_system/style_guides/` to find the exact filename/key.

### Best Practices for Image Updates

1. **Archive Before Replace**: Always rename existing images (e.g., `filename_old.png`) instead of overwriting immediately. This allows for easy rollbacks.
2. **Abstract > Realistic**: For professional portfolios, abstract representations often integrate better with minimalist themes than realistic stock-style images.
3. **Prompt Guardrails**: Always include negative constraints like "no text", "no people" (if applicable), and "high contrast" to maintain the "Hiromix" aesthetic.
4. **Unified Cache Busting**: When updating assets, update the CSS version in *every* HTML file that uses those assets, even if the CSS file itself didn't change significantly, as it forces the browser to re-evaluate the DOM and its linked resources.
5. **Prompt Approval**: Before running expensive or slow AI generations, present the proposed prompt to the user for final sign-off.

## Lessons Learned: Creative Asset Generation (2026-01-25)

### Session Overview
Successfully generated and integrated 4 new thematic blog images and 1 replacement logo. Refined prompt engineering techniques to move from strictly abstract patterns to literal yet stylistic scenes that maintain site-wide aesthetic consistency.

### What Worked Well

#### 1. Transition to Narrative Imagery
- **Literal Scenes**: Moving from "abstract patterns" to "literal objects" (clocks, boots, CRT monitors) added depth and narrative interest to the hover previews while staying within the lo-fi constraints.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Using objects that metaphorically represent the blog content (e.g., alarm clocks for habits, CRT monitor for AI struggle) improved the user experience.

#### 2. Prompt Engineering Refinements
- **Negative Constraints**: Consistently using "no text" and "no people" prevented common AI artifacts and ensured the imagery felt professional and focused. For book stacks, specify "no titles on books" to prevent AI from generating illegible text.
- **Technical Style Tokens**: Combining "high contrast flash photography", "90s digital grain", and "lo-fi aesthetic" created a consistent visual language across all generated assets.
- **Scene Composition**: Specifying "macro shot" or "stark shadows" helped control the visual weight and focus of the images.

### Key Prompts Developed
- **Habits**: "A stack of vintage alarm clocks on a wooden surface, high contrast flash photography, 90s digital grain, harsh shadows, lo-fi aesthetic, no text"
- **Success/Effort**: "A pair of well-worn leather boots next to a stack of old leather-bound books, high contrast flash photography, 90s grainy aesthetic, absolutely no text, no letters, no words, no titles on books, lo-fi grain"
- **AI/Tech**: "A vintage CRT monitor displaying green glitch static and lines of code in a dark room, messy wires, high contrast flash, 90s lo-fi grain, no text"
- **Influence/Mood**: "A macro shot of a rain-streaked window pane at night with blurred distant city lights, high contrast flash, 90s grainy photography, melancholic lo-fi vibe, no text"

### Technical Workflow Improvements
- **Standardized Naming**: Adopted the `blog-[id]-master.png` convention for all hover preview images to maintain a clean root directory.
- **Unified Cache Busting**: Implementing site-wide version bumps (e.g., `v=3.0` -> `v=3.1`) for every asset update session ensures all users see the latest visuals without manual intervention.

## Content & Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Conversational & Personal**: Mirror the tone of the blog entries, narrative-driven but grounded in facts and logic.
- **Direct & Kinetic**: Get straight to the core concept. Use direct statements following the pattern: "Doing [action] led to [outcome] which had [impact]."
- **Fact-Based Logic**: Focus on the technical, operational, and logical details of a task rather than emotional responses or "how it felt."
- **Detail-Oriented**: Stick to specifics, technical implementations, and concrete outcomes. Avoid vague or abstract statements.

### Structural & Grammatical Constraints
- **No Em Dashes**: Replace all em dashes (—) with commas for cleaner, more conversational flow.
- **Direct Framing**: Avoid "It wasn't about X, it was about Y" patterns. State the core concept directly without contrasting what it's not.
  - ❌ Bad: "This wasn't about catching mistakes—it was about building a system for continuous improvement."
  - ✅ Good: "Creating feedback mechanisms that turned quality assessments into actionable improvement plans built a system for continuous improvement."
- **Buzzword Prohibition**: Strictly avoid corporate clichés and dramatic language:
  - Banned: "palpable", "spearheading", "walking into a storm", "synergy", "leverage", "touch base", "move the needle"
  - Avoid overly dramatic framing like "facing severe challenges" or "critical junctures"
- **Australian English**: Always use AU spelling consistently:
  - optimisation (not optimization)
  - standardised (not standardized)
  - realise (not realize)
  - programme (not program, except in technical contexts like "C programming")
  - centralised (not centralized)
  - specialised (not specialized)
  - organise/organisation (not organize/organization)

### Content Structure Patterns
- **Problem → Solution → Impact**: Structure narratives around what was broken, what you built/did, and what measurable result occurred.
- **Technical Specificity**: Name actual tools, frameworks, and methodologies (e.g., "spaCy models and DuckDB" not "advanced NLP tools").
- **Margin Notes as Themes**: Use margin notes to highlight key concepts, technical tools, or thematic elements rather than generic skill categories.

### Lessons Learned: Portfolio Refactoring (2026-01-26)

**Session Overview**: Rewrote all content on About and Projects pages to adopt a conversational, blog-like tone while maintaining technical depth and factual accuracy.

#### What Worked Well

1. **Narrative-First Approach**: Transforming rigid corporate sections (Overview, Initiatives, Skills) into cohesive stories with a clear logical progression made the content more engaging and readable.

2. **First-Person Voice**: Using "I" and "my" brought personal perspective to the forefront, matching the reflective tone of blog entries without becoming emotional or subjective.

3. **Direct Impact Statements**: Restructuring sentences to follow "doing XYZ led to XYZ which had impact XYZ" pattern created clearer cause-and-effect narratives.

4. **Technical Detail Preservation**: Maintained all key technical details (NLP pipeline, DuckDB, SIEM/UEBA, API integration) while embedding them in natural narrative flow.

5. **Thematic Margin Notes**: Updated margin notes from generic corporate tags to thematic concepts that better reflect the actual work:
   - "Cross-functional leadership" → "Interdepartmental governance"
   - "Data storage solutions" → "The NAS transition"
   - "Skills developed" → Specific technical implementations

#### What Didn't Work (and Was Fixed)

1. **Em Dashes (—)**: Initial draft used em dashes extensively for emphasis and parenthetical statements. These felt too formal and interrupted the conversational flow. Replaced all with commas.
   - Before: "Customer service was disconnected from logistics—logistics from technical development"
   - After: "Customer service was disconnected from logistics, logistics from technical development"

2. **"It Wasn't About X, It Was About Y" Framing**: This construction felt indirect and defensive. Replaced with direct statements of what the work actually accomplished.
   - Before: "This wasn't about catching mistakes—it was about building a system for continuous improvement."
   - After: "Creating feedback mechanisms that turned quality assessments into actionable improvement plans built a system for continuous improvement."

3. **Dramatic Language**: Initial draft included phrases like "walking into a storm" and "palpable disconnect" which felt too dramatic for a professional portfolio. Removed all dramatic metaphors in favor of direct problem statements.
   - Before: "When I stepped into the role, I was walking into a bit of a storm. There was a palpable disconnect..."
   - After: "When I was designated as the NPS improvement lead in August 2022, Samsung's eCommerce operation was sitting in the bottom performance quantile. The problem was systemic."

4. **Overly Abstract Language**: Removed vague phrases like "demonstrated craftsmanship" and "thoughtful creation" in favor of specific technical choices.
   - Before: "Required solution that demonstrates craftsmanship while maintaining authentic voice"
   - After: "Maintaining full control over the DOM, performance, and user experience drove this choice"

#### Specific Examples of Improvements

**Government & Public Policy Section**:
- Added graduation date (Nov 2015) to subtitle
- Added new section on SA Chief Scientist innovation project as the foundational "origin story" for data-driven approach
- Updated margin notes to reflect this foundational work

**eCommerce CX Lead Section**:
- Replaced generic "Leadership & Strategy" headers with specific technical sections like "The Data Pipeline" and "Technology as the Enabler"
- Added detail about D+1 NLP pipeline using spaCy and DuckDB
- Changed "Impact & Recognition" to simply "The Results" with concrete metrics

**This Site Project**:
- Removed philosophical language about "code as expression" and "craftsmanship"
- Focused on technical rationale: DOM control, performance, semantic HTML, progressive enhancement
- Explained specific architectural decisions (CSS custom properties, responsive grid, ARIA attributes)

#### Key Patterns to Maintain

1. **Start with the Problem**: Every role/project should begin by explaining what was broken, inefficient, or missing.

2. **Explain the Logic**: Describe why specific technical choices were made, not just what was implemented.

3. **Close with Measurable Impact**: End with concrete outcomes (percentages, timeframes, scale) rather than subjective achievements.

4. **Use Commas for Flow**: Commas create natural pauses and maintain conversational rhythm without the formality of em dashes.

5. **Active, Direct Language**: Prefer active constructions that state what was done and why, avoiding passive voice and indirect framing.

#### Australian English Compliance
- Conducted final pass to ensure all spelling adhered to AU standards
- Fixed one inconsistency: "Agile Transformation Program" → "Programme"
- Verified no US spellings remained in narrative content (JS API calls like `behavior: 'smooth'` are exempt as they're part of Web APIs)

#### CSS Version Management
- Updated CSS version from 3.9 → 4.0 → 4.1 → 4.2 across refactoring sessions
- Ensured both about.html and projects.html always use matching version numbers
- Documented that version should be bumped after any content changes to force cache refresh
