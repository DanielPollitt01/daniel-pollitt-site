This era was defined by the transition from physical media to networked storage, requiring a disciplined approach to redundancy and disaster recovery.</p>

                    <h3>End-to-End SME Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Provided holistic hardware and software deployments, taking full responsibility for the technical stack. This included server integrations, network architecture, and custom software configurations. A highlight of this period was the implementation of a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) solution for Inghams Chicken in Adelaide, which required seamless integration between front-of-house operations and backend inventory management.</p>

                    <h3>The Trusted Advisor Role</h3>
                    <p>In the SME space, technical capability is only half the battle; the other half is trust. I operated as a 'fractional CTO' for many clients, translating complex technical requirements into business outcomes. This involved not just installing hardware, but managing the lifecycle of technology and ensuring that infrastructure scaled alongside the business without creating technical debt.</p>

                    <h3>Skills Developed</h3>
                    <p>Infrastructure design and deployment. Client relationship management and needs assessment. Disaster recovery planning and implementation. Network security and administration. Vendor management and procurement. Entrepreneurial business operations and lifecycle management.</p>

                        <p>Bridging the gap between low-level computer science fundamentals (Harvard CS50) and high-level kinetic data science (IBM & 2025 Analytics Report). This study program focuses on transforming raw data into operational momentum through advanced statistical learning and custom NLP pipelines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section-divider"></div>

                    <h3>NLP & Kinetic Data Science</h3>
                    <p>Developed a high-performance NLP pipeline utilizing Python’s <strong>spaCy</strong> models and <strong>DuckDB</strong> for vectorised execution. This system revolutionized the D+1 escalation analysis workflow, reducing processing time from hours of manual collation to minutes of automated insight generation. By automating the identification of linguistic patterns in customer sentiment, the team moved directly from "what happened" to root cause ideation and project execution.</p>

                    <h3>Operational Impact & Revenue Protection</h3>
                    <p>Leveraged DuckDB and SQL-based analysis to support the launch of 3PD retail marketplaces. By building real-time inventory and order management data pipelines, I provided the technical foundation for manual workflows that protected <strong>7-figure revenue streams</strong> during critical launch windows. Implemented Bayesian "signal vs. noise" frameworks to flatten detractor peaks and identify logistics damage patterns before they reached critical mass.</p>

                    <h3>Foundational Computing (Harvard)</h3>
                    <p>Mastered the low-level mechanics of memory management, pointers, and manual resource allocation through C programming. Studied fundamental data structures and algorithmic complexity (Big O notation), providing the necessary context to understand the trade-offs between execution speed and developer productivity in high-level analytical tools.</p>

                    <h3>Statistical Learning (ISLR)</h3>
                    <p>Undertook deep study of Statistical Learning principles, focusing on the bias-variance trade-off and model flexibility. Applied these frameworks to operations, choosing interpretable models (Decision Trees, Linear Regression) to explain underlying drivers of customer behavior rather than treating predictions as black boxes.</p>
