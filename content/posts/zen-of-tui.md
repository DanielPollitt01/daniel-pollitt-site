The terminal is not just a tool; it is a philosophy. In a world of bloated web interfaces and distracting notifications, the Text User Interface (TUI) offers a sanctuary of focus.

When you live in the terminal, your fingers never leave the home row. Every command is a deliberate action, every pipeline a creative solution. It's about taking back control from the "lowest denominator" experiences that modern operating systems force upon us.

I've found that moving my entire workflow to neovim, tmux, and a few well-chosen CLI tools has increased my productivity by an order of magnitude. It's not about being a "hacker"; it's about being an artisan of your own digital environment.
